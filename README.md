**Description**
This program is made to assist people with their home workouts. Create your own sequential workout routine consisting of several pre-defined or custom exercises. Then, simply focus on completing the workout while Drill Sergeant keeps you on pace, notifying you of important tracking information such as:

    -How many sets you have left of an exercise
    -How much time remains before the start of the next set
    -What percent of the workout you've currently completed
      etc...
  
Drill Sergeant saves all of your created workouts, so performing them again later on is easy.
